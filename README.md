To play Connect4 against an AI player, simply run the file referee.py. On the user's turn, the user should enter valid integers that correspond to the desired column number, valid meaning within the width of the board (starting from 1). 

To exit the game, the user should can either type 'exit' or break out of the command line by doing Ctrl+C. The referee.py file can be modified to set the dimensions of the board as well as set the depth of the AI.

The AI player has a choice of two algorithms: a classic minimax search algorithm and a minimax with alpha-beta pruning. By default, the AI player uses the latter for quicker moves at a higher depth.
