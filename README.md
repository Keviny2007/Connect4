To play Connect4, the user should enter valid integers that represent the 
desired column number, valid meaning within the width of the board (starting 
from 1). 

To exit the game, the user should simply
type "exit". The referee.py file can be modified to set the dimensions of the 
board as well as set the depth of the AI.
